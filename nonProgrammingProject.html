						<h4> I run at the same time range and run the same route since April 2020. I wasn't intending this to be my project and I started this because I wanted to have some happiness in my daily life. However, I see this action is making some impact on my community and to myself so I decided to record this as my non-coding project. 

						<br> <br> ***** Progress *****
						<br> <br> As of July 2020, some people talk to me, wave their hand to me, and start to introduce themselves to me and other runners/walkers. It is small but making a positive community. I've learned from this project that if you stick with anything and keep sharing to outside, possible to give some impacts. It also affected me because I've started to run 5 days a week because it is nice to start my day by seeing my people in the morning. When we greet, we naturally smile at each other and it makes me feels good and gives me hope for the day. This became a big encouragement for me to stay active and also stay positive.

						<br> <br>  ***** Record ***** 
						<br> <br> 1st month(April): Everyone was doing their own business. No greeting or smile back to me.

						<br><br>  2nd month(May): Some people started greeting or smiled back to me.

						<br><br>  3rd month(June): Some people started wave their hands from far away.

						<br><br>  4th month(July): Most people wave their hands with their smiles, and some are even come down to the street to have some chat. One man clapped his hands and cheered me from his car while I was passing him. A woman told me I made her day. Since we are in the pandemic, I think people are looking for any happiness in their life including me.
