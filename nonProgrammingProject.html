						<h4> I started to greet people while I'm running. I run at the same time range on the same route 5 days a week since April 2020. I wasn't intending this to be my project and I started this because I wanted to have some happiness in my daily life. However, I see this action is making some impact on my community so I decided to record this as my non-programming project. 

						<br> <br> Progress: As of July 2020, people started to talk to me and some are started to introduce themselves to me and others. It is small but making a positive community. I've learned from this project is that if you keep stick with anything, others will acknowledge and possible to make some impacts. 

						<br> <br> 1st month(April): Everyone was doing their own business. No greeting or smile back to me. 
						<br><br>  2nd month(May): Some people started greeting or smiled back to me.
						<br><br>  3rd month(June): Some people started wave their hands from far away.
						<br><br>  4th month(July): Most people wave their hands with their smiles, and some are even come down to the street to have some chat. One man clapped his hands and cheered me from his car while I was passing him. A woman told me I made her day. Since we are in the pandemic, I think people are looking for any happiness in their life including me.
